## Log

### Day 1 - January 2, 2021

First day, lots of investigation, decided to start the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. 

Set up my computer for the rest of the challenge:

- Installed VS Code, Git.
- Forked this repo.

On FreeCodeCamp, started with the **Responsive Web Design Certification** and completed the following classes:

1. Basic HTML and HTML5
2. Basic CSS

Also, I need to learn Git/Github.

### Day 2 - January 3, 2021

Sencond day, finally got my git configured with `user.name` and `user.email` (this was actually done last night after I had already commited to the repo).

On FreeCodeCamp I was able to complete the lesson Applied Visual Design, where among other things I was able to draw a heart shave as well as a a crescent moon shape.

I also learnet a bit of Color Theory, which I will need to go over again, maybe tomorrow to better understand everything.

I also learned about CSS animations with the \@keyframes rule. Learned about bezier curves, iteration counts, etc. I will try to read more about these topics too, looks like fun.
