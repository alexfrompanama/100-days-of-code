### Day 1 - January 2, 2021

First day, lots of investigation, decided to start the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. 

Set up my computer for the rest of the challenge:

- Installed VS Code, Git.
- Forked this repo.

On FreeCodeCamp, started with the **Responsive Web Design Certification** and completed the following classes:

1. Basic HTML and HTML5
2. Basic CSS

Also, I need to learn Git/Github.
