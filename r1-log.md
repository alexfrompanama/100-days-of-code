## Log

### Day 1 - January 2, 2021

First day, lots of investigation, decided to start the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. 

Set up my computer for the rest of the challenge:

- Installed VS Code, Git.
- Forked this repo.

On FreeCodeCamp, started with the **Responsive Web Design Certification** and completed the following classes:

1. Basic HTML and HTML5
2. Basic CSS

Also, I need to learn Git/Github.

### Day 2 - January 3, 2021

Sencond day, finally got my git configured with `user.name` and `user.email` (this was actually done last night after I had already commited to the repo).

On FreeCodeCamp I was able to complete the lesson Applied Visual Design, where among other things I was able to draw a heart shave as well as a a crescent moon shape.

I also learnet a bit of Color Theory, which I will need to go over again, maybe tomorrow to better understand everything.

I also learned about CSS animations with the `@keyframes` rule. Learned about bezier curves, iteration counts, etc. I will try to read more about these topics too, looks like fun.

### Day 3 - January 4, 2021

Today I went throught the Applied Accessibility module of FreeCodeCamp. 

Lots of new information from when I first started looking at HTML. There are a lot more tags that give more meaning to the HTML code and helps screenreader users better understand and navigate the content of the website.

Learned about the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guide as well as general guidelines for colorblind users (which is great since I'm a strong protan).

Definetively lots of more reading needed for the topics covered in Day 2 and 3 I expect to come back to these topics for the FCC challenges in the comming days.

### Day 4 - January 5, 2021

Today I almost skipped the day but in the end I completed two FreeCodeCamp modules, Responsive Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox.

With these two modules I learned about viewports and new size units `vh, vw, vmin, vmax` as well as a basic technique for displaying images in a high resolution display.

CSS Flexbox seems really nice for designing websites, this is another topic I will be reviewing and trying to get deeper into. Maybe on the weekends I will review some of these topics to see what's possible.

### Day 5 - January 6, 2021

Today I learned about CSS Grid, this one I remember from the last time I was reading about HTML and CSS. This looks like a powerful system to create responsive website layouts.

Next up are the 5 FreeCodeCamp projects. I will need to create:

1. A tribute page.
2. A survey form.
3. A product landing page.
4. A technical documantation page.
5. A personal portfolio page.

I will be reading more about where I will be hosting these, hopefully get an environment going and have my first sketches about these websites.
